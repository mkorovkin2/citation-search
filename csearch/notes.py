# GET FULL DATASET STATISTICS (SCALING STATISTICS/DISTRIBUTION)
    # Comment/clean up code
    # Publications instead of references on the output screen
# Do the same thing for number of self-citations on a paper
    # (Limit to recent year papers) last 5-7 years
        # This can be a search option (like a checkbox)

# Refine: first or last author self-citation rates -> and calculate their rates (for overall AUTHOR STATISTICS)
    # When calculating overall statistics

# # # #

# Title/year/where (details of paper)
    # Just 1st and last authors OPTION
    # Author list
    # Link / dio / pubmed link / pubmed central link
    # Size of dataset used to generate teh graph

    # First and last author statistics on the publication page

# Report length of cited_in
    # If data not there, just say data not found
    # Year of the paper

# Analysis of the self-citations: instead of comp

# Display self-citation number (with frequency)
# ?? Author stats included
# ?? Looking up a paper by name

# Fix multiple-names

# Note in output about looking for only the author's names
    # Name matching

# ! Better matching !
    # Retrieve names

# Name matching... - Get exploratory statistics/"contains" statistics

# Title search

# Possible: create an API to get the statistics
    # Look into AJAX (loading...)

# UseHistory - UIDs might be cached
    # Show name matching results on web page

# - - -

# LIbraries for name matching with non unicode characters
# Fix the period at the end of a publication (doesn't appear)


# Background analysis for first and last authors (population) -- distribution must be authors


# Write down the methodology for building background data

# Fit data with difference of linear curve

#Try to do a drop down with closest 5 papers

# Name as big as self citation frequency
        # Pull TITLE OF PAPER with all other data for ease of display
